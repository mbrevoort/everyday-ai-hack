I started a new repo here and chose Python just to begin to build more familiarity with it. I used the email overflow AWS account and started to set up a new SES receiver under the domain ai.brevoort.com. 
I'm not quite through creating the Lambda function and I haven't created it on the AWS side. I was just editing the deploy.sh file, but I was able to get Docker set up with the dev container.

Successfully got SES, S3, and Lambda configured properly to be able to receive email and print contents in the lambda

Next steps: try to pass the results to Open AI and Send and reply with the Open AI response.
